# DFS-BFS-Simulation
This is a simulation of the two famous searching algorithms : Breadth First Search and Depth First Search. I created this mini project to complement my Problem Resolution course during my first year in my computer vision masters. 
Python with pygame were used in the creation of this script

## To run the program 
install pygame with the command : 
> pip install pygame
